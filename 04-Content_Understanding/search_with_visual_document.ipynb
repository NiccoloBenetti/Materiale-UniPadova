        "This document illustrates an example workflow for how to leverage the Azure AI Content Understanding API to enhance the quality of document search.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sample will demonstrate the following steps:\n",
        "1. Extract the layout and content of a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
        "2. For each figure in the document, extract its content with a custom analyzer using Azure AI Content Understanding, and insert it into the corresponding location in the document content.\n",
        "2. Chunk and embed the document content with LangChain and Azure OpenAI, and index them with Azure Search to generate an Azure Search index.\n",
        "3. Utilize an OpenAI chat model to search through content in the document with a natural language query.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pre-requisites\n",
        "1. Follow the [README](README.md) to create the required resources for this sample.\n",
        "1. Install the required packages.\n"

The spending is categorized into four groups: Individuals, Businesses, SLGs (State and Local Governments), and Others. In 2020, the total spending was approximately 9% of GDP, with Individuals accounting for the largest share, followed by Others, Businesses, and SLGs. In 2021, the spending decreased to around 5% of GDP, with Individuals still being the largest category, but with reduced contributions from Others and Businesses. By 2022, the spending further decreased to about 1% of GDP, with Individuals and Others contributing equally. In 2023, the spending slightly increased to about 2% of GDP, with Individuals again being the largest category, followed by Others, Businesses, and SLGs.\n**Summary**: The chart illustrates the trend of federal government spending from 2020 to 2023, showing a significant decrease from 9% of GDP in 2020 to about 2% in 2023.

The structural primary balance is a measure of the government's fiscal position, excluding interest payments on debt. In 2019, the US had a structural primary balance of approximately -3, while the Euro Area had a slightly better balance, close to -2. During the fiscal impulse period, both regions experienced significant increases in cumulative deficits. The US's deficit increased to around -8, while the Euro Area's deficit increased even more dramatically to about -12.\n**Summary**: The chart illustrates the change in general government structural primary balance from 2019 to the fiscal impulse period for the US and Euro Area.

The Case-Shiller House Price Index shows a steady increase over the period, starting at 100 in December 2019 and reaching approximately 150 by September 2023. The S&P 500 Index exhibits more volatility, initially dropping below 100 in early 2020, then rising sharply to peak around 160 in late 2021, followed by fluctuations and ending at approximately 160 in September 2023.\n**Summary**: The Case-Shiller House Price Index has shown a consistent upward trend from December 2019 to September 2023, indicating a steady increase in house prices.

The U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few years.  \nRather than facing lasting negative hysteresis effects from the pandemic, the U.S. is the only G20\neconomy that is now operating above the levels of output and employment expected prior to the\npandemic.

During the recovery from the\npandemic, labor shortages lifted real wages at the bottom of the income distribution and led to a\ncompression of wage inequality.2 Despite these gains, poverty increased by 4.6 percentage points in\n2022 and the child poverty rate more than doubled.3 This rise in poverty can be directly attributed to\nthe expiration of pandemic-era assistance, particularly changes that had been made to the Child Tax\nCredit and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\nDeliquency Rate on Credit Card Loans - All Commercial Banks\n(percent, seasonally Adjusted)\nThe increased pressure on lower income\nhouseholds is becoming more visible in an\n3\nupswing in delinquencies on revolving credit.\nFurthermore, worsening housing affordability has\n2.5\naggravated access to shelter, particularly for the\nyoung and lower income households.

What Has Underpinned the Post-Pandemic Strength in Demand?  \n2\\. The unprecedented increase in the fiscal deficit during the depths of the pandemic\nprovided significant fuel to demand. The cumulative increase in federal spending in 2020-21 was\naround 19 percent of GDP. While somewhat smaller than that of the Euro Area, the extraordinary\nbreadth of this (relatively untargeted) fiscal support is providing a material boost to aggregate\ndemand in 2023-24 through multiple channels:  \n· Federal transfers to households (through stimulus checks, food assistance, child and earned\nincome tax credits, and unemployment insurance), combined with foregone consumption and\ndebt rescheduling (e.g., of mortgages and student loans), added an estimated 10 percent of\nGDP to household savings by end-2021. These resources were then subsequently available to\nsupport consumption even as real disposable income fell (due to the post-pandemic burst of\ninflation).  \n· Large transfers to state and local governments prevented a drawdown of rainy-day funds in the\npandemic, providing subnational governments with sizable buffers which, in turn, allowed them\nto maintain their spending above pre-pandemic levels.  \n· Around 31/2 percent of GDP in federal loans provided through the Payroll Protection Program\nwere subsequently forgiven, bolstering corporate balance sheets. Other targeted pandemic\nmeasures (e.g., for airlines) also supported the corporate sector.  \n\n==================================================\n"

During the recovery from the\npandemic, labor shortages lifted real wages at the bottom of the income distribution and led to a\ncompression of wage inequality.2 Despite these gains, poverty increased by 4.6 percentage points in\n2022 and the child poverty rate more than doubled.3 This rise in poverty can be directly attributed to\nthe expiration of pandemic-era assistance, particularly changes that had been made to the Child Tax\nCredit and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\nDeliquency Rate on Credit Card Loans - All Commercial Banks\n(percent, seasonally Adjusted)\nThe increased pressure on lower income\nhouseholds is becoming more visible in an\n3\nupswing in delinquencies on revolving credit.\nFurthermore, worsening housing affordability has\n2.5\naggravated access to shelter, particularly for the\nyoung and lower income households.
